class Transcript:
    """Represents a foundation model session's transcript.

    A ``Transcript`` provides access to the complete session history of a
    LanguageModelSession, including all user prompts, model responses, and tool
    invocations. The transcript is automatically updated after each interaction
    with the model.

    **Transcript Format:**

    The transcript follows the Foundation Models Swift framework structure and is
    organized as a dictionary containing:

    - **version**: Integer version number (currently 1)
    - **type**: String identifier "FoundationModels.Transcript"
    - **transcript**: Object containing:
        - **entries**: List of session entries, each with:
            - ``id``: Unique UUID for the entry
            - ``role``: One of "instructions", "user", "response", or "tool"
            - ``contents``: Array of content objects with ``type``, ``id``, and type-specific fields

    **Entry Types by Role:**

    - **instructions**: System instructions and tool definitions
        - ``tools``: Array of available tool definitions
        - ``contents``: Array with text instructions
    - **user**: User messages and requests
        - ``contents``: Array of content objects (text and more)
        - ``options``: Optional configuration for the request
        - ``responseFormat``: Optional structured output schema
    - **response**: Model-generated responses
        - ``toolCalls``: Array of tool invocations (if tools were called)
        - ``contents``: Array of response content (text or structured data)
        - ``assets``: Array of model asset identifiers used
    - **tool**: Tool execution results
        - ``toolName``: Name of the executed tool
        - ``toolCallID``: UUID linking to the tool call
        - ``contents``: Array with tool execution results

    **When Transcripts Are Updated:**

    - After each ``respond()`` call completes successfully
    - After each ``stream_response()`` completes
    - After tool invocations are processed
    - NOT during streaming (only after completion)
    - NOT if a request fails or is cancelled

    Examples:
        Accessing transcript after session::

            import apple_fm_sdk as fm

            session = fm.LanguageModelSession()

            await session.respond("Hello!")
            await session.respond("What is Python?")

            # Get the full session history
            transcript = await session.transcript.to_dict()

            # Access the entries
            entries = transcript["transcript"]["entries"]
            for entry in entries:
                role = entry["role"]
                print(f"Entry role: {role}")
                if "contents" in entry:
                    for content in entry["contents"]:
                        if content["type"] == "text":
                            print(f"  Text: {content['text']}")

        Monitoring session length::
            import apple_fm_sdk as fm

            session = fm.LanguageModelSession()

            for i in range(5):
                await session.respond(f"Question {i}")

                transcript = await session.transcript.to_dict()
                entry_count = len(transcript["transcript"]["entries"])
                print(f"Session has {entry_count} entries")

        Examining tool calls in transcript::

            import apple_fm_sdk as fm
            from my_tools import CalculatorTool

            session = fm.LanguageModelSession(
                tools=[CalculatorTool()]
            )

            await session.respond("What is 15 * 24?")

            transcript = await session.transcript.to_dict()

            # Find entries with tool calls
            for entry in transcript["transcript"]["entries"]:
                if entry["role"] == "response" and "toolCalls" in entry:
                    print(f"Tool calls: {entry['toolCalls']}")
                elif entry["role"] == "tool":
                    print(f"Tool result for {entry['toolName']}")

        Saving session history::

            import apple_fm_sdk as fm
            import json

            session = fm.LanguageModelSession()

            # Have a session
            await session.respond("Hello")
            await session.respond("Tell me about Python")

            # Save transcript to file
            transcript = await session.transcript.to_dict()
            with open("session.json", "w") as f:
                json.dump(transcript, f, indent=2)

    Note:
        - The transcript object shares the session's internal pointer
        - Transcripts are read-only; you cannot modify session history
        - Large sessions may result in large transcript dictionaries
        - The transcript format follows the Foundation Models Swift framework structure
        - Accessing the transcript does not affect the session state

            The transcript preserves the *history* of tool calls (what was called and
            what the results were), but not the *capability* to make new tool calls.
            Tool definitions stored in a transcript JSON will appear in the transcript's
            content history, but they will **not** be automatically available for the model
            to call. That's because the transcript doesn't actually contain the tool
            implementations. To allow the model to invoke tools mentioned in the transcript,
            implement each tool in Python and then create a session with both the transcript
            and tools using :meth:`~apple_fm_sdk.session.LanguageModelSession.from_transcript`
